## Important Notes
1. This database is set up and ready to use with your RYDO Web App
2. The connection string has been updated in all necessary files
3. All MongoDB models have been properly configured
4. The database is empty and ready for your application to populate with data

2. Restrict IP access to only your application's IP address
3. Enable MongoDB Atlas backups for data protection
