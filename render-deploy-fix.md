# RYDO Web App - Render.com Deployment Fix

## Build Failure Issue
The build is failing because the build command is just `npm` without any arguments. Render.com needs a specific command like `npm install` to properly build your application.

## How to Fix the Deployment

1. Go to your Render.com dashboard
2. Select your RYDO Web App service
3. Click on "Settings"
4. Scroll down to the "Build & Deploy" section
5. Update the following settings:

   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `node backend/server.js`

6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

## Additional Deployment Tips

If you continue to face issues, try these alternatives:

### Option 1: Use package.json scripts
Make sure your package.json has the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node backend/server.js",
  "build": "echo 'Build completed'"
}
```

### Option 2: Create a simple build script
Create a build.sh file in your project root:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm install
echo "Build completed successfully!"
```

Then set your build command to: `sh ./build.sh`

### Option 3: Deploy without build
If your app doesn't require a build step, you can set the build command to:
`echo "No build required"`

## Environment Variables
Make sure all your environment variables from env-for-render.txt are properly set in the Render.com dashboard under the "Environment" section.
